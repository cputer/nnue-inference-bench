## Hero Section 1: Main Landing

### Headline
**The Compiler for Real-Time AI**

### Subheadline
Mind is a programming language and compiler that delivers deterministic, portable, high-performance AI inference. Write once, run anywhere - from gaming to robotics to finance.

### Key Stats (from verified benchmarks)
- **15.3x** faster than Python (GPU)
- **2.8x** faster than Python (C++ baseline)
- **100%** deterministic (checksum-verified)

## Hero Section 2: Benchmark Results

### Headline
**Proven Performance, Not Promises**

### Body
Every number we publish is reproducible. Our benchmarks include:
- Full methodology documentation
- Checksum validation (bit-exact results)
- One-command reproduction

### NNUE Inference Results

| Implementation | Throughput | Speedup |
|----------------|------------|---------|
| Python (baseline) | 29,041 pos/s | 1.0x |
| C++ | 81,687 pos/s | 2.8x |
| CUDA GPU | 445,345 pos/s | 15.3x |

*All implementations produce checksum 0x6C1B4100 - bit-exact match.*

### CTA

## Value Props

### Deterministic
Same input = same output, every time. No more debugging non-reproducible bugs. Critical for safety systems, regulated industries, and production ML.

### Fast  
Compiler-optimized code that rivals hand-tuned C++ and CUDA. Whole-program optimization finds speedups that JIT compilers miss.

### Portable
One codebase targets CPU, NVIDIA GPU, Apple Metal, and WebGPU. Stop rewriting for every platform.

## Technical Credibility Section

### Our Methodology
We believe in transparent benchmarking:
- **Tier B (End-to-End)**: We measure real workloads, not microbenchmarks
- **Checksums**: Every implementation must match bit-for-bit
- **Reproducible**: Clone, run, verify - no special setup required

### Open Source
Our benchmarks, methodology, and reference implementations are public. Verify our claims yourself.
